    <h1>A little more about me!</h1>

<h2>Start</h2>

                <p> 
                 I am from <u>Uberl√¢ndia</u> , MG , but most of the youth were in <u>Nova Ponte</u> ,
                a smaller city that is in the same state ,
                 I've always been interested in video games early on in my life, general sports, music,
                technology and the underground scene, skateboarding, graffiti.
                I am quite extroverted , I always try to see life in a positive way and with this small project,
                I seek to enter the technological world that I have always been passionate about ,
                but I had never given it enough attention until today
                I want to work for a company that wants everyone's success and also potential individual talents.
                I really admire American pop culture, as well as the American lifestyle,
                 I want to contribute as much as I can
                to the evolution of the technological world to be increasingly accessible,
                evolved and making people's lives easier in general,
                in general that's it.

                    Thanks!!.

                </p>
